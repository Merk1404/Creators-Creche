<tbody>
<tr> <td align="center"> HUMAN </td>  <td class="easyread"> The most common face to see in Faerûn, humans are known for their tenacity, creativity, and endless capacity for growth.</td>
		<td class="easyread">   <li>Humans are a simple class, they are generally accepted by the people you will encounter, though they do have their own prejudices.</li>
  					<li>A strong and stout people whose genetics allow them to carry an increased load of twenty-fice percent, making them the perfect choice for players interested in hoarding. </li>
		</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">ELF  </td> <td class="easyread"> With an ethereal countenance and long lifespans, elves are at home with nature's power, flourishing in light and dark alike. </td> 
	<td class="easyread">  
			<li>These long-lived creatures are graceful yet powerful due to their Elven Weapon Training. With a strong affinity with magic, elves offer the perfect ethereal choice for players. </li>
  			<li>See up to 40ft in the shadows with Dark Vision, allowing players to stay alert in dungeons and caves when traps might be afoot. </li>
 			</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">DROW </td>  <td class="easyread">Driven to the Underdark, most drow have adopted a ruthless pragmatism. While the Lolth-sworn delight in the goddess' evil tenets, the Seldarine reject Her attempt to overthrow the leader of the elven pantheon. </td> 
		<td class="easyread"> 
  				<li>When the Drow people do leave the Underdark, they are met with hostility and hatred by the people of the Overworld. Making them either the perfect underdog or evil overlord base!</li>
 				<li>They share the same Fae Ancestry as Elves, offering both races the inability to be Charmed.</li> 
				</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">HALF-ELF </td>   <td class="easyread"> Half-Elves inherit blessings from both their parents, but at the price of never quite fitting in. Curious, ambitious, and versatile, half-elves are welcome everywhere, but struggle without a community to call their own. </td> 
		<td class="easyread">   <li>The best of both worlds, Half-Elves are cross-bred between an Elf and a Human giving them the perks of both races. 
</li>
  				<li>Half-Elves often find it difficult to find a place to belong, their blood is not pure enough for Elves, and Humans think them to be too different making these adventurers outcasts. 
</li>
 				</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">HALF-ORC </td>   <td class="easyread"> Creatures of intense emotion, Half-Orcs are more inclined to act than contemplate - whether the rage burning their bodies compels them to fight, or the love filling their hearts inspires acts of incredible kindness.</td> 
		<td class="easyread">  
  				<li>Born from both Humans and Orcs ancestry, their appearances differ widely though they tend to lean more towards the Orc parent. </li>
 				<li>Take down enemies with Savage Attacks and Relentless Endurance making these characters the best tanks. </li> 
				</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">HALFING </td>  <td class="easyread"> Small yet capable, halflings prefer the comforts of home and hearth - but their natural luck and dexterity makes them fine adventurers. </td> 
		<td class="easyread"> 
  				<li>Small but mighty, this race’s small stature allows them to stay hidden amongst the crowds, the first step to a great pick-pocket. </li>
 				<li>Legends and great stories sing through the dwarven blood, providing them with Strong-Heart Resilience. </li> 
				</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

		
<tr> <td align="center">DWARF </td>  <td class="easyread"> As durable and unyielding as their homes of stone, dwarves are some of the finest warriors, miners, and smiths of Faerûn. </td> 
		<td class="easyread">   
  				<li>Known for their confidence, or cockiness, Dwarves tend to make great Bards and Barbarians. </li>
 				<li>Their strength from generations of hard labour and mining has developed into military skills with swords, war hammers and other melee weapons. 
</li> 
				</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">GNOME  </td>  <td class="easyread"> Small, clever, and energetic, gnomes use their long lives to explore Faerûn's brightest corners and darkest depths. </td> 
		<td class="easyread">  
  				<li>Witty, clever and skillful gnomes are cunning creatures that work smarter rather than harder. </li>
 				<li>Blessed with centuries of education and literature this race has developed Artificers Lore, allowing your character to add their proficiency ontop of their History checks. 
</li> 
				</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">TIEFLING </td>  <td class="easyread"> Descended from devils of the Nine Hells - by blood or curse - tieflings face constant suspicion in Faerûn. Their arcane abilities make them natural survivors, whether as heroes or villains.</td> 
	<td class="easyread">   <li>Feared and hated by many Tieflings are degraded and belittled by the majority of Faerun. 
</li>
  				<li>Tieflings are able to speak and read Infernal, impacting what your character will and will not be able to learn. 
</li>
 				<li>Calling the flames of the Hells home, this race has become resistant to Fire damage and attack with Hellish Rebuke. </li> 
				</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">GITHYANKI </td>   <td class="easyread"> With a ruthlessness borne from mind flayer enslavement, githyanki ride the Astral Sea atop red dragons, bringing their silver swords and psionic might to bear against any trace of the illithid menace. </td> 
		<td class="easyread">   <li>These warrior people pride themselves on honour and victory, forging them into the perfect soldier for any battle.</li>
  				<li>While foreign to Faerun, this race can adapt and thrive in any realm, and Faerun is no different. Though all Githyanki wish to one day return to the Astral Realm and Ascend for their Queen. 
</li>
 				<li>Players looking for a character unmoving from morals and instead focus on strategy and success then the Githyanki are your perfect pick. 
</li> 
				</td></ul> </td>  </tr>

<tr> <td align="center">DRAGON<br>BORN </td>   <td class="easyread"> A proud race that values clan and skills above all else. Once enslaved by dragons, they strive to be self-sufficient, not wanting to be beholden to anyone, not even the gods. </td> 
		<td class="easyread"> 
  				<li>The most fantastical race, the Dragonborn people resemble their dragon ancestors while also retaining some of their abilities as well. Due to their striking looks the people of Faerun will either love or loathe you. 
</li>
 				<li>With ten separate sub-races, Dragonborn offers players the most choice within one race, each subclass offers their unique abilities and spells.</li> </td></ul></tr></tbody>
